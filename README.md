========

A sbt plugin for creating NiFi Archive bundles to support the classloader isolation model of NiFi.
Many functionality is from project [sbt-pack](https://github.com/xerial/sbt-pack) and [nifi-maven](https://github.com/apache/nifi-maven)

### Features

- `sbt nar` creates a distributable package in `target/nar` folder
  - All dependent jars including scala-library.jar are collected in `target/nar/META-INF/bundled-dependencies` folder
  - Create `target/nar/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` with necessary properties
- `sbt narArchive` generates `nar` archive that is ready to distribute
  - The archive name is `target/{project name}-{version}.nar`
- `sbt generateDocProcessors` generates documentation html files in folder `docs` for processors (subclass of `org.apache.nifi.processor.AbstractProcessor`)
  - Each processor has own html file `docs/${processor-name}.html` that is generated by NiFi
  - `docs/index.html` contains list of processors
